        <h1>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Overview</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
            <p>SEO is the practice of optimizing web content to improve visibility and ranking in search engine results. It involves making strategic changes to your website's content, structure, and code to ensure that search engines like Google can understand it better and rank it higher for relevant searches.</p>
            <p>When done right, SEO can help a website appear on the first page of results for keywords and phrases that are important to the site's goals. Think of it like trying to be the first name someone mentions when asked for a recommendation — SEO helps your site be that name.</p>

            <h2>Why is SEO Important?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increased Traffic:</strong> Higher rankings bring more visitors. Websites that appear on the first page of search engine results receive the majority of traffic, making SEO essential for exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Better UX:</strong> SEO prioritizes speed, accessibility, and usability. A well-optimized site not only ranks higher but also creates a smoother experience for users, which reduces bounce rates and boosts engagement.</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Organic search is free compared to ads. While paid ads offer short-term visibility, SEO provides long-term results with lower ongoing costs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In short, SEO is a digital version of word-of-mouth — the better your presence, the more trustworthy and visible your content becomes over time.</p>

            <h2>Types of SEO Strategies</h2>

            <h3>1. On-Page SEO</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Optimize titles, meta tags, and headers to clearly reflect the page’s topic and keywords.</li>
                <li>Use relevant keywords naturally in your content without overstuffing. Tools like Google Keyword Planner can help identify effective terms.</li>
                <li>Strong internal linking connects your pages and helps users (and search engines) navigate your site more easily.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Think of on-page SEO like organizing your store: clean signs, clear paths, and good layout all help people find what they need.</p>

            <h3>2. Off-Page SEO</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Build backlinks from trusted sources, such as news sites, educational institutions, or industry leaders. Backlinks act like “votes of confidence.”</li>
                <li>Social media and guest blogging can drive traffic and increase brand exposure beyond your own website.</li>
                <li>Brand mentions and online reputation also factor into how search engines view your authority.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Off-page SEO is your reputation in the digital neighborhood — it’s what others say about your site when you’re not in the room.</p>

            <h3>3. Technical SEO</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Improve page load speed by optimizing images, using caching, and reducing unnecessary scripts.</li>
                <li>Mobile-first design ensures that your site works well on smartphones and tablets, which is now a major ranking factor.</li>
                <li>Structured data, XML sitemaps, and clean URLs help search engines crawl and index your content more effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Technical SEO is like making sure your store’s doors open properly, the lights are on, and everything’s accessible to customers and inspectors alike.</p>

            <h2>SEO Best Practices</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Use descriptive, keyword-rich URLs that tell users and search engines what the page is about. Example: <code>/learn-html-basics</code> is better than <code>/page?id=123</code>.</li>
                <li>Compress and tag images with alt attributes to improve load speed and accessibility for screen readers.</li>
                <li>Make sure your site is mobile-friendly, with responsive layouts and touch-friendly buttons.</li>
                <li>Publish valuable, original content that answers user questions and solves problems — content is still king.</li>
                <li>Update content and fix broken links regularly to maintain site credibility and user satisfaction. A stale site falls behind quickly.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Following these best practices ensures your website stays optimized over time and adapts to changing search algorithms.</p>
